::: {#image-heading}
The sensors from `Fine Offset` are re-branded and partly modified by the resellers. This article deals with sensors from the german re-seller `froggit` and the US re-seller `ecowitt`. More precise the [DP-/GW SmartHubs](https://www.foshk.com/Wifi_Weather_Station/GW1100.html) WiFi Gateway with temperature, humidity & Pressure which is developed by fine offset. The unique selling point of the LoRa-Wifi gateway is the extraordinarily extensive possibility of connecting radio-bound sensors.

# Features

Currently, depending on the gateway, a maximum of 8 sensors of the following types can be connected at the same time:

-   [DP150/WN51](https://www.froggit.de/media/products/DP150_BDA_EN.pdf) soil temperature sensors,
-   [DP50/WH31](https://www.froggit.de/media/products/DP50_BDA(DE).pdf) multi channel temperature and humidity sensors
-   [WN34](https://osswww.ecowitt.net/uploads/20220803/WN34S%20WN34L%20Manual.pdf) wire probe thermometer
-   [DP10/WN35](https://www.froggit.de/media/products/DP10_BDA_EN.pdf) leaf wetness sensors
-   [DP100](https://www.froggit.de/media/products/DP100_BDA(DE).pdf) soil moisture sensors;

a maximum of 4:

-   [DP200/WH41/WH43](https://www.froggit.de/media/products/DP200_BDA(DE)_1.pdf) PM2.5/PM10 sensors
-   [WH45](https://osswww.ecowitt.net/uploads/20220803/WH55%20Manual.pdf) Water leak sensors

a maximum of 2:

-   [DP250/WH45](https://www.froggit.de/product_info.php?info=p483_dp250-5-in-1-co2-pm2-5-pm10-temperatur-luftfeuchte-innenraum-luftqualitaets-funksensor.html) CO2 / PM2.5 / PM10 / temperatur / moisture sensor
-   [DP60/WH57](https://www.froggit.de/media/products/DP60-Manual_EN_.pdf) Lightning sensor

For the basic weather parameters as rain, wind vector insolation temperature and humidity one of the compatible outdoor basis units as the [DP1100](https://www.froggit.de/media/products/DP1100_BDA_DE_.pdf) or [WH3000](https://www.froggit.de/media/products/WH3000_BDA_Ausseneinheit_DE_.pdf)


## Calibration Concept

The low budget sensors are usually lacking of a stable measurement quality. To obtain reliable micro climate data a two step calibration process is suggested.

1.  The measurements of all sensors (preferably in a climate chamber) will be statistically analysed to identify sensor which produce systematic and significant outliers.
2.  The sensors are calibrated against an operational running high price reference station in the field.

## Future Calibration Plans

For the future a machine learning approach including the radiation, azimuth, temperature and humidity as predictors for the calibrated temperature as the response variable will be used as an rolling calibration tool.
